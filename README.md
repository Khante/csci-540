Advanced Databases Final Project

Run `docker-compose build` to update build.

Run `docker-compose up` to start project.

App should be visible on `localhost:5000` or `0.0.0.0:5000`

Mongo data will be saved locally under `/data/mongodb`

Local `/games_api` is mounted inside the API container so you can make changes without having to rebuild.
